## Testing environment

In the testing environment You have  20 credits for testing purposes. All identifications are reviewed by automatic system and our manual reviewers team. You should expect one callback per identification with manual and auto results. But there is an option to get two callbacks, one after automatic check and second one after manual review. If You want to get two callbacks please contact us. This environment's purpose is to try our system's features and test sytem after integration part before going to the production environment. 

## Development environment

In the development environment you have 100 credits, but identifications won't be reviewed manually, just by atomatic system, so You could integrate our system much faster. In this environment there is no option to get two callbacks. For development environment manual results are simulated from auto results.

## Production environment

After You have successfully intagrated and tested our system, You can move to the production environment.
